    "A/B testing to determine whether SHVR or ZIP traders perform better using BSE market sessions simulation. Test the null hypothesis that there is no signifacnt difference between the two traders and the alternative hypothesis of there being a signifacnt difference between the two traders with the significance value set to 0.05. A market session will run with the specification mentioned on the brief. start time and end time are set to 0 and 600 respectively. After the simulation are complete, two data frames are created, one with everything the \"dump_avgbals\" creates and another only taking in the average profit of each trader at a time step. To test the hypothesis, a \"T test\" was used, this test allows to see whether the observed differences are statistically significant. Some helper functions are below to help do what was described. The functions \"make_df\" and \"ttest\" are helper functions for \"run_market_sim\" which create a dataframe and conduct t-test for each market session. the p value is then added to an array and the average of it returned."
